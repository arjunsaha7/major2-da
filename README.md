This project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze student performance from the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. It cleans and renames columns, creates student names, calculates total and average marks, finds the topper, measures consistency, estimates subject difficulty, and even predicts dropout risk based on performance patterns. The project also studies the relationship between attendance and marks and assigns grades to students. Finally, it visualizes trends, difficulty levels, consistency, and student comparisons using clear graphs, making it easy to understand how students are performing overall.
